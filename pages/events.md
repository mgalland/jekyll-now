## Software and Data Carpentry workshops

**13-14 January 2019**: I organised a two-day [Software Carpentry workshop](https://scienceparkstudygroup.github.io/2019-14-01-Amsterdam-Python-workshop/) in Amsterdam to teach biologists basic skills in programming. This served as a "kickstart" for experimental life scientists that need to learn some programming in order to perform their research. Since 1998, the [Software Carpentry](https://software-carpentry.org/) foundation teaches researchers computing skills to speed up their research and embrace good practices.

**March 13-14 March 2018**: I participated to the Software Carpentry intructor training organised by Mateusz Kuzak on behalf of the eScience Center. Upon certification, this training allows one to self-organise its own Carpentry workshops. I am looking forward to that!

**13-14 December 2017**: I co-organised a two-day [Data Carpentry workshop](https://aschuerch.github.io/2017-12-13-amsterdam/) in Amsterdam to help biologists to find their way in genomics. I was lucky to be able to teach a small part of the workshop on day two (fastq file quality check). Thanks to Anita SchÃ¼rch, Dennis Schmitz and Sam Nooij for this opportunity!

**17-18 October 2016**: I co-organised a two-day [Software Carpentry workshop](https://mkuzak.github.io/2016-10-17-amsterdam/) in Amsterdam to teach biologists basic skills in programming. This was the first Software Carpentry workshop in Amsterdam.

## Specific events

**June 25-27, 2019: Carpentry Connect 2019: Building a local Carpentries institutional framework**: I co-organised a workshop session during the [Carpentry Connect 2019](https://software.ac.uk/ccmcr19/programme) to gather issues and solutions on community building based on the Carpentries Foundation experience and philosophy. A blog post and a section in the Carpentries Handbook are in the making based on the outputs of this workshop.

**December 15, 2017: Snakemake day**: after the success of the first Snakemake day in Paris, the [second Snakemake day](https://snakemake-days.github.io/) took place in Amsterdam on December 15 2017. It brought together the creator of Snakemake [Johannes Koster](https://johanneskoester.bitbucket.io/) together with regular users of Snakemake at both the expert and beginner levels.   

From the creator of Snakemake:
> Snakemake is a workflow engine and language. It aims to reduce the complexity of creating workflows by providing a fast and comfortable > execution environment, together with a clean and modern domain specific specification language (DSL) in python style.

The next Snakemake day event will be help in Essen (Germany) and organised by Johannes Koster.
