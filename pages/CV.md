# Short introduction
I am a support data scientist at the University of Amsterdam (Swammerdam Institute for Life Sciences) helping fellow researchers on Research Data Management and Data Analysis. On a daily basis, I work mostly with Plant Scientists that are struggling with various (plant) genomics and other "omics" issues. I also participate in a pilot project at the University of Amsterdam to implement the [iRODS](https://irods.org/) Open Source Data Management Software together with a graphical use interface called ["YODA"](https://yoda.sites.uu.nl/) developed by the University of Utrecht.  
To reach out to more scientists and gather a community of computational life scientists, I also coordinate a Mozilla Study Group called the ["Amsterdam Science Park Study Group"](www.scienceparkstudygroup.info).

# Expertise

# Training and support activities

## Carpentries workshop
__2019-01-14/15:__ Software Carpentry workshop in Amsterdam. Co-organizer (together with Like Fokkens) and teacher (Shell basics and Git/Github). 24 attendees. [Website link](https://scienceparkstudygroup.github.io/2019-14-01-Amsterdam-Python-workshop/).
__2019-02-05/06:__ Data Carpentry Genomics workshop in Wageningen. Teacher (Variant Calling). 35 attendees.
__2017-12-12/13:__ Data Carpentry Genomics workshop in Amsterdam. Co-organizer and teaching. 26 attendees.


## Community building and guidance
Since 2017, I coordinate a small group of biologists willing to make progress in scientific programming (data visualisation, genomics, statistics, etc.). It is called "Amsterdam Science Park Study Group" and is officially linked to the [Mozilla Science Lab](https://science.mozilla.org/) organisation. I make sure that regular one-hour sessions take place (every two weeks) and participate in lesson development. Sessions can also be longer (afternoons) to dive further into a topic of interest. Furthermore, I regularly organise two-day Carpentries Foundation workshop as part of the Amsterdam Study Group activities.
