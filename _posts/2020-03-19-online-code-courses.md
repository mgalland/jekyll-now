Because of these corona-days, I have made and sent around a list of useful online resources to learn programming and data analysis using R and Python. I hope it is useful for others as well.


## Data analysis with R

* What I'd recommend is to suscribe to DataCamp and enroll in the following career track: https://learn.datacamp.com/career-tracks/data-analyst-with-r  
* This online book is also very complete and thorough: https://moderndive.com/index.html  
* The other option, less extensive, is to self-study Carpentries-style courses: 
  * https://carpentries-incubator.github.io/open-science-with-r/ 
  * https://carpentries-incubator.github.io/git-Rstudio-course/
 
## Bioinformatics and Python programming
* A great book to get started: https://vincebuffalo.com/book/ 
* Lessons are not per se on bioinformatics but rather give a set of good practices and basic programming skills: https://software-carpentry.org/lessons/ 
* Whenever you want to install something on your computer, the conda software manager is a great and easy solution for that: https://carpentries-incubator.github.io/introduction-to-conda-for-data-scientists/index.html 

## Omics
* A lesson on RNA sequencing still in its infancy but already run once! https://scienceparkstudygroup.github.io/rna-seq-lesson/ 
* The official Data Carpentry genomics lesson: https://datacarpentry.org/genomics-workshop/ 


## Various topics
* The lesson name says it all! https://datacarpentry.org/image-processing/ 
* A presentation that I've made for the EPS graduate school council that summarises data and code "tips and tricks" for wet-lab biologists: https://zenodo.org/record/2561849
