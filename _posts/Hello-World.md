title: Personal introduction
---

I am a Plant Bioinformatician and Data Scientist living in the Netherlands (picture). Originally trained as a "wet-lab" Plant Molecular Biologist, I progressively drifted towards Genomics and Data Science. Presently, I work at the University of Amsterdam as a PostDoctoral Researcher on Tomato Genomics. 

To help Life Scientists facing issues in statistics and genomics, I coordinate a [Mozilla Study Group](https://scienceparkstudygroup.github.io/studyGroup/) and regularly organise events related to Bioinformatics and Data Science (https://snakemake-days.github.io/).
