I am a PhD Candidate in the [Microbiology Doctoral Training Program](https://microbiology.wisc.edu/)
at [University of Wisconsin - Madison](http://www.wisc.edu/). I do my dissertation work 
in [McMahon Lab](https://mcmahonlab.wisc.edu/).  Click [here for more about me](about.md).




I am a Plant Bioinformatician and Data Scientist living in the Netherlands (picture).
Originally trained as a "wet-lab" Plant Molecular Biologist, I progressively drifted towards Genomics and Data Science. 
Presently, I work at the SILS institute [University of Amsterdam](http://sils.uva.nl/) as a PostDoctoral Researcher on Tomato Genomics in the 
group of Dr. Petra Bleeker. Click [here for more about me](about.md).

To help Life Scientists facing issues in statistics and genomics, I coordinate a [Mozilla Study Group](https://scienceparkstudygroup.github.io/studyGroup/) and 
regularly organise events related to Bioinformatics and Data Science (https://snakemake-days.github.io/).
