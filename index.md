I am a Plant Bioinformatician and Data Scientist living in the Netherlands (picture).

Originally trained as a "wet-lab" Plant Molecular Biologist, I progressively drifted towards Genomics and Data Science. 
Presently, I work at the [Swammerdam Institute for Life Sciences (University of Amsterdam)](http://sils.uva.nl/) as a PostDoctoral Researcher on Tomato Genomics in the 
group of [Dr. Petra Bleeker](http://www.uva.nl/en/profile/b/l/p.m.bleeker/p.m.bleeker.html). Click [here for more about me](about.md).

To help Life Scientists facing issues in Bioinformatics, Statistics, Data Science and Genomics, I coordinate a [Mozilla Study Group](https://scienceparkstudygroup.github.io/studyGroup/) and 
regularly organise [events](events.md) related to Bioinformatics and Data Science.
