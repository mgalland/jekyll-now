## Training workshops
### Software and Data Carpentry 
**17-18 October 2016**: I co-organised a two-day [Software Carpentry workshop](https://mkuzak.github.io/2016-10-17-amsterdam/) in Amsterdam to teach biologists basic skills in programming. This served as a "kickstart" for experimental life scientists that need to learn some programming in order to perform their research. Since 1998, the [Software Carpentry](https://software-carpentry.org/) foundation teaches researchers computing skills to speed up their research and embrace good practices.

## Study Group (community of scientific programmers)
In coordination with the [Mozilla Foundation Science lab](https://science.mozilla.org/) and together with the DTL community manager [Mateusz Kuzak](https://www.linkedin.com/in/mateusz-kuzak-b548a714b/), I co-founded the Amsterdam Science Park Study Group to gather computational biologists working in Science Park at the University of Amsterdam. The group now regularly gathers researchers from IBED and SILS to perform demonstrations of  bioinformatic and computational tools, train experimental biologists, solve issues and coordinate actions in computational biology.
